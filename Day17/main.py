# Dynamic Typing
# Python is a dynamically typed language. This means that you do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object.

a = 5
print(a)
print(type(a))
a = "Hello"
print(a)
print(type(a))
# Variables data type is changed from int to string
